## üìã Environment Setup

To set up the project with the new improvements:

1. Copy environment template:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Add your actual API keys to `.env.local`:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=your_ga_id
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Run development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
